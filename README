TODO (as of 14/9/12):
Design interface
Improve upon validation, specifically: Implement password policy, check uploaded file is not the same as another, and a few others =P
code to change uploaded text into html (ie adds <p>, <b>, <br>, lists, images)
ability to up and down vote (work in progress)
	need to get table creation working, then implement actual voting mechanism
Some form of user validation technique, probably reCAPCHA, although email validation is still cool and a lot of work.
