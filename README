TODO (as of 21/10/12):
Design interface
Improve upon validation, specifically: Implement password policy, check uploaded file is not the same as another, and a few others =P
code to change uploaded text into html (ie adds <p>, <b>, <br>, lists, images)
Some form of user validation technique, probably reCAPCHA, although email validation is still cool and a lot of work.
