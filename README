TODO (as of 09/05/13):
Design interface
Implement check to see that uploaded file is the same as another
Strenghten password policy
Implement some form of user validation technique, probably reCAPCHA, although email validation is still cool and a lot of work.

Add some form of administration (ie ability to remove posts)
